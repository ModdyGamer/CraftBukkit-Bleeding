# This is the help configuration file for Bukkit.
# By default you do not need to modify this file. Help topics for all plugin commands are automatically provided by
# or extracted from your installed plugins. You only need to modify this file if you wish to add new help pages to
# your server or override the help pages of existing plugin commands. This file is divided up into two parts:
# general-topics and command-topics respectively. Examples are given below. Color codes are allowed.

# general-topics:
#     rules:
#         shortText: Rules of the server
#         fullText: |
#             1. Be kind to your fellow players.
#             2. No griefing.
#             3. No swearing.
#         permission: topics.rules
#
# command-topics:
#     stop:
#         description: Stops the server cold....in its tracks!
#         usage: /stop (and then no more)
